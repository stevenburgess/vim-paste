This project will attempt to explain vims paste flag.

:set paste? To check pastes current status (also shows up next to the word
INSERT in vim)
:set paste! To toggle paste mode

With paste turned off, copy the text from the python file to the pain text file.
If you are using a .vimrc similar to mine, the formating will be all messed up,
as vim tries to give you the correct spacing and newlines.

Turn on paste and do it again. You should see that the exact format you copied
since paste mode deactivates all the fancy formating options.
